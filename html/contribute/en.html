            If you like this extension and want to contribute, there are different ways:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Translations</strong>:
                So far, the extension is available in five languages (English, French, Spanish, Polish, and Japanesse), and it would be great if more languages are added.
                Do you speak Italian, German, ...?
                Do not hesitate and contribute to the internationalization of the extension.
                I've created a GitHub repository with the translatable texts.
                The URL is <a href="https://github.com/rumoroso/headingsmap_translations/tree/main">https://github.com/rumoroso/headingsmap_translations/tree/main</a>.
                If you have any doubt or any question, you can send an email to the address that I created for the extension: <a href="mailto:headingsmap@gmail.com?subject=Translation for headingsMap extension">headingsmap@gmail.com</a>.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Feed-back</strong>:
                Another way to contribute is by sharing your feedback, ideas for improvements, reporting bugs or unexpected behavior, etc.
                Many of the improvements and fixes that the extension had were proposed by users.
                You can send any comment that you would like to share about the extension and about what it does or how it works.
                You can do it by writing to the email address <a href="mailto:headingsmap@gmail.com?subject=Feedback for headingsMap extension">headingsmap@gmail.com</a>.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Sharing it</strong>:
                If you like the extension, you can also share it (with your colleagues, on social networks,...)
            </li>
            <li><strong>Donate</strong>:
                If you are open to it as a form of collaboration, you can also support the development:
                <form action="https://www.paypal.com/donate" method="post" target="_blank" lang="en" style="display: inline-block">
                    <input type="hidden" name="business" value="A8KA5SAF7BJDG"/>
                    <input type="hidden" name="amount" value=""/>
                    <input type="hidden" name="no_recurring" value="0"/>
                    <input type="hidden" name="currency_code" value="EUR"/>
                    <button type="submit" class="donate_button">donate with Paypal</button>
                </form>
            </li>
        </ul>
