            <dt data-version="4.3.1">7/5/2023 (v 4.3.1)</dt>
            <dd>Prevent focus on hidden elements. When the dialogs (settings, help, release notes, etc.) are
                closed, they were still focusable, so when accessing with keyboard, the focus went through all
                their items. The change prevents that.</dd>
            <dd>Added the keyboard keys arrowRight and arrowLeft to expand/collapse the tree nodes (when they
                are focused).</dd>
            <dd>When an item is focused, the key "enter" sets the focus in the header that corresponds with
                it.</dd>

            <dt data-version="4.3.0">6/5/2023 (v 4.3.0)</dt>
            <dd>Added a button to copy the tree to the clipboard.</dd>
            <dd>Added the option to "open always" for the current URL.</dd>
            <dd>Improved the code that generates the menus, so now they are real buttons.</dd>
            <dd>It includes some accessibility improvements.</dd>

            <dt data-version="4.2.3">23/3/2023 (v 4.2.3)</dt>
            <dd>Updated the way in which it can be kept open.</dd>

            <dt data-version="4.2.2">29/3/2023 (v 4.2.2)</dt>
            <dd>Improved the way in which the panel takes space from the body when opening and resizing.</dd>

            <dt data-version="4.2.1">21/3/2023 (v 4.2.1)</dt>
            <dd>Now there is some space between the panel and the body.</dd>
            <dd>There were some changes in the code that, although are not user oriented, were required to improve
                the code quality, so it is better to maintain and to include future changes.</dd>

            <dt data-version="4.2.0">14/3/2023 (v 4.2.0)</dt>
            <dd>Added the keyboard shortcuts to toggle the nodes in the tree by heading level. On Windows, use the
                combination "alt" key with any key number to collapse (or expande) the tree nodes that correspond with
                headings of that the same level as the number. For instance, "alt + 2" collapses (or expand) all nodes
                created from h2 elements. On Mac, the combination is "ctrl + cmd" with the heading level. This behavior
                is only available for the "headingsMap" tree but not in the "HTML5 outline" tree.</dd>
            <dd>Fixed the problem of the wrong styles in the panel when it is i a new tab that is not focused directly
                (for instance, when one link is opened in a new tab).</dd>

            <dt data-version="4.1.0">13/3/2023 (v 4.1.0)</dt>
            <dd>When opening the panel, the BODY element margin is kept when opening it. By this way, there is some
                spacing between the panel and the body contents.</dd>

            <dt data-version="4.0.0">7/3/2023 (v 4.0.0)</dt>
            <dd>There is a new the option to open the extension automatically. It can be set to open it always or only
                in the domain of the page that is active. The way to use it is by a menu (with the "pin" icon) included
                in the top bar and that includes both options that is open by using the "pin" icon button.</dd>
            <dd>Now the option to switch the panel position has its own button in the top bar.</dd>
            <dd>The settings menu is also accessible directly in the top bar.</dd>
            <dd>New option to consider or ignore the headings without content. They are ignored by default (in previous
                versions they were always considered).</dd>
            <dd>The dialogs (for settings, help, etc.) has changed a bit in the way in which it is displayed.</dd>
            <dd>This release also includes other changes to improve how the functionality is injected and executed.
                There were tests to check that everything worked as expected, but most likely I missed scenarios that
                could occur. If there is something unexpected in the behavior or in the results, please contact me to
                the mail <a href="mailto:headingsmap@gmail.com">headingsmap@gmail.com</a>.</dd>

            <dt data-version="3.10.1">26/7/2021 (v 3.10.1)</dt>
            <dd>When the header element (h1 to h6 elements) uses the attribute <em>aria-level</em>, the extension uses
                it to identify its level.</dd>
            <dd>Improved the styles for the dialogs.</dd>
            <dd>Added the Spanish translation.</dd>
            <dd>New contribution section.</dd>
            <dd>Removed the "refresh results" menu option.</dd>

            <dt data-version="3.10.0">28/2/2021 (v 3.10.0)</dt>
            <dd>Added the optional visual reference that helps to identify the headers/sections that are currently in
                the viewport. When the page scrolls, if the header (or section for the HTML Outline tree) is in the
                viewport, the corresponding item is highlighted in the tree by changing its background and with a 4px
                line in its right side. This option can be activated in the settings panel (checkbox with label "Relate
                with viewport")
            </dd>
            <dd>Fixed bug in the headingsMap tree when the option to consider hidden headers was active</dd>
            <dd>Improved the accessibility of the component</dd>

            <dt data-version="3.9.1">7/12/2020 (v 3.9.1)</dt>
            <dd>Fixed bug that caused content of elements with role "presentation" to be ignored</dd>
            <dd>Published the <a href="https://rumoroso.bitbucket.io/headingsmap/todo.html">list of potential
                improvements and new features</a>. The list is built based on also on market requirements and users
                feedback
            </dd>

            <dt data-version="3.9.0">10/10/2020 (v 3.9.0)</dt>
            <dd>Hide tab when HTML5 Outline analysis is not active (to activate it, check "settings > HTML 5 Outline
                tree")
            </dd>
            <dd>Added ellipsis style to the main header (when the option "wrap long texts" is active, it also wraps the
                text)
            </dd>
            <dd>Added Privacy Policy content and menu link</dd>

            <dt data-version="3.8.3">29/6/2020 (v 3.8.3)</dt>
            <dd>Updated font-family used by the tooltip</dd>

            <dt data-version="3.8.2">28/6/2020 (v 3.8.2)</dt>
            <dd>Added an optional tooltip that shows information about the header or section (it is shown when moving
                the mouse over the tree). It can be activated in the options dialog and it is disabled by default
            </dd>
            <dd>Replaced select elements with checkboxes in the options dialog. By this way, the user only needs to
                click once to switch the option value
            </dd>
            <dd>Added keyboard interaction to the tree, so when an item has the focus:
                <ul>
                    <li>arrow-up/arrow-down: move the focus the next of previous item</li>
                    <li>enter key: collapse/expand item nested group</li>
                    <li>escape key: if the tooltip is shown, it closes it</li>
                </ul>
            </dd>

            <dt data-version="3.8.1">21/6/2020 (v 3.8.1)</dt>
            <dd>Added the option to identify what are the elements that the tool consider hidden. When the option to
                consider hidden elements is active (for the headers and/or HTML5 Outline tabs), an icon is shown at the
                right side of the items that correspond with hidden elements and the total amount is shown as legend at
                the bottom. Bear in mind that the way in which the extension identifies hidden elements is based in
                estimations according to their styles, but documents can implement alternative ways to hide contents
                (thanks to Alireza Esmikhani for suggestions of new features, and for reporting bugs, both for this
                version and the previous one)
            </dd>
            <dd>Updated to use shadow DOM</dd>
            <dd>Updated list of requested features to analyse:

                    </li>
